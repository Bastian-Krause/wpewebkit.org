# wpewebkit.org

WPE website done in [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
using the template [Start Bootstrap - Stylish Portfolio](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/stylish-portfolio/).

In order to test it you need to install Jeykyll
you can do it with the following commands in a Debian based system:

    sudo apt-get install jekyll

And then you can run the command `jekyll build` that will generate
the site under `_site` folder.
BTW, you can use `jekyll serve` to test it locally.

In order to write a new release or security advisory piece in the website
you just have to create a new file inside `_posts` folder using
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) syntax.
